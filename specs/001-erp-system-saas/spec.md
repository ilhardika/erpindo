## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a business seeking comprehensive ERP capabilities, we need a SaaS platform that provides subscription-based access to essential business modules (POS, inventory, sales, HR, finance) with proper role segregation where system administrators can manage multiple companies, company owners can manage their employees and operations, and staff can access only their assigned functions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Dev (System Owner) Scenarios:**

1. **Given** the system is operational, **When** a Dev creates a new subscription plan, **Then** the plan is available for companies to subscribe with defined modules and pricing
2. **Given** companies are registered, **When** a Dev views the company management dashboard, **Then** they can see all companies with their subscription status, contact details, and activity status
3. **Given** the system has users, **When** a Dev accesses global user management, **Then** they can view all users across all companies with their roles and basic information (excluding company-specific operations)

**Company Owner Scenarios:**

1. **Given** a company is subscribed to a plan, **When** the Owner logs into the dashboard, **Then** they see subscription details, payment status, and available modules based on their plan
2. **Given** the Owner needs to add an employee, **When** they create a new staff account, **Then** the employee can login with provided credentials and access only assigned modules
3. **Given** business operations are running, **When** the Owner views company reports, **Then** they can see comprehensive analytics across all subscribed modules

**Staff (Employee) Scenarios:**

1. **Given** a staff member has been assigned to POS operations, **When** they login, **Then** they can process sales transactions but cannot access HR or financial data
2. **Given** a warehouse staff member needs to update inventory, **When** they access the inventory module, **Then** they can manage stock levels and transfers within their permissions
3. **Given** a staff member attempts to access restricted modules, **When** they try to navigate there, **Then** the system prevents access and shows appropriate permissions message

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a company's subscription expires? (System should restrict access to paid modules)
- How does the system handle when an Owner tries to assign modules not included in their subscription? (Should show upgrade prompts)
- What occurs when a Dev deactivates a company account? (All company users lose access)
- How does the system behave during payment processing failures? (Graceful degradation with notifications)
