# Feature Specification: ERP System (SaaS) - ERPindo

**Feature Branch**: `001-erp-system-saas`  
**Created**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ERP System (SaaS) - ERPindo with multi-tenant architecture, role-based access control, and subscription management"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - System Owner Setup and Company Onboarding (Priority: P1)

A System Owner (Dev) needs to create subscription plans, onboard new companies, and provision their initial Owner accounts so companies can start using the ERP system.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the SaaS business model - without this, no companies can be onboarded and no revenue can be generated.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a subscription plan, registering a company, and verifying the Owner can log in with appropriate module access based on their plan.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a System Owner, **When** I create a new subscription plan with specific modules and pricing, **Then** the plan becomes available for company registration
2. **Given** a subscription plan exists, **When** I register a new company with an Owner account, **Then** the Owner receives login credentials and access only to modules included in their plan
3. **Given** a company is registered, **When** I activate/deactivate their account, **Then** their access is immediately enabled/disabled across all users

### User Story 2 - Company Owner Employee Management (Priority: P2)

A Company Owner needs to add employees, create staff accounts, and assign specific ERP module permissions so their team can perform daily business operations.

**Why this priority**: Companies need to onboard their staff to start using the ERP functionality - this enables the core business value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by an Owner adding employees, assigning them to specific ERP modules, and verifying staff can only access assigned modules.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a Company Owner, **When** I add a new employee with specific ERP module permissions, **Then** they receive login credentials and dashboard shows only their assigned modules
2. **Given** an employee exists, **When** I modify their module permissions, **Then** their dashboard immediately reflects the changes
3. **Given** I have multiple employees, **When** I view the employee list, **Then** I can see each employee's role and assigned modules

---

### User Story 3 - Staff Daily ERP Operations (Priority: P3)

Staff members need to access their assigned ERP modules to perform daily operations like sales, inventory management, customer service, and financial transactions.

**Why this priority**: This delivers the core business value to end users, but depends on proper setup from higher-level roles.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a staff member logging in and successfully completing transactions within their assigned modules (e.g., processing a sale in POS, updating inventory).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a staff member with POS access, **When** I log in, **Then** I see only the POS module and can process sales transactions
2. **Given** I have inventory module access, **When** I update stock levels, **Then** the changes are immediately reflected across all relevant modules
3. **Given** I have multiple module access, **When** I navigate between modules, **Then** all my actions are properly logged and restricted to my permissions

---

### User Story 4 - Subscription Management and Billing (Priority: P2)

Company Owners need to view their subscription details, payment history, and upgrade/downgrade their plans to access different modules as their business grows.

**Why this priority**: This enables business growth and recurring revenue - critical for SaaS sustainability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by an Owner viewing billing history, changing subscription plans, and verifying module access updates accordingly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a Company Owner, **When** I view my subscription dashboard, **Then** I see current plan, billing history, and available upgrade options
2. **Given** I want to upgrade my plan, **When** I select a higher tier plan, **Then** new modules become available and billing is updated
3. **Given** my payment is due, **When** the billing cycle completes, **Then** I receive proper notifications and service continues uninterrupted for successful payments

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a Company Owner tries to assign modules not included in their subscription plan?
- How does the system handle when a company's subscription expires or payment fails?
- What occurs when a System Owner needs to migrate a company between subscription plans?
- How does the system respond when staff members try to access modules they don't have permission for?
- What happens when multiple staff members try to modify the same inventory item simultaneously?
