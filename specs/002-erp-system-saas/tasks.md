- **Tier 5**: Consolidation (Finance, Dashboard Enhancement)

---

## üé® UI CONSISTENCY STANDARDS

**Established Patterns**: Based on completed Customers, Suppliers, Inventory, and Stock Movements modules

### Pattern A: Full CRUD Modules (Separate Pages)

**Use for**: Main entities with complex forms and detailed views
**Examples**: Customers, Suppliers, Products, Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Employees

**Required Components**:

1. **{Entity}Table Component** (`src/components/{module}/{entity}-table.tsx`)
   - Card wrapper with CardContent
   - Search bar with icon (left-3, top-1/2, -translate-y-1/2)
   - Filter dropdowns (category, status, etc.)
   - Refresh button with spin animation
   - Table with rounded-md border
   - DropdownMenu for row actions (View/Edit/Delete)
   - Debounced search with useDebounce hook
   - Loading and empty states

2. **{Entity}Form Component** (`src/components/{module}/{entity}-form.tsx`)
   - Reusable for both create and edit
   - Card sections for logical grouping (e.g., Basic Info, Additional Details)
   - Label + Input pattern (NOT FormField pattern)
   - `register()` for inputs, `watch()` + `setValue()` for Selects
   - Error messages as `<p className="text-sm text-red-500">`
   - Form Actions section with Cancel (outline) + Submit buttons
   - Loading spinner on submit button

3. **Pages Structure**:
   - `/erp/{module}/page.tsx` - List page using {Entity}Table component
   - `/erp/{module}/new/page.tsx` - Create page using FormLayout + {Entity}Form
   - `/erp/{module}/[id]/page.tsx` - Detail view (read-only) with Card layout
   - `/erp/{module}/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Edit page using FormLayout + {Entity}Form

**Key Features**:

- DataTableLayout for list pages
- FormLayout for create/edit pages
- DetailLayout for detail pages (read-only)
- Card wrappers with CardHeader/CardContent
- Consistent spacing (space-y-4, space-y-6)
- Icons from Lucide React
- Toast notifications for all actions

### Pattern B: Inline CRUD (Single Page)

**Use for**: Reference data, configuration, simple entities
**Examples**: Product Categories, Product Units, Warehouses, Customer Categories, Supplier Categories

**Required Structure**:

1. **Single Page** (`/erp/{module}/{entity-plural}/page.tsx`)
   - Card wrapper with CardContent
   - Add New button with Dialog/Modal
   - Table with inline Edit/Delete actions
   - Search bar (optional, if many records)
   - No separate routes needed

2. **Dialog Component** (optional, if complex)

   - DialogFooter with Cancel + Save buttons

**Key Features**:

- All operations on single page
- Quick add/edit with dialogs
- Immediate feedback with toast
- No navigation required
- Simpler than Pattern A

### Pattern C: Read-Only Display

**Use for**: History, logs, reports, view-only data
**Examples**: Stock Movements, Transaction History, Audit Logs

**Required Structure**:

1. **Single Page** with Card wrapper
   - Search and filter controls
   - Read-only table (no edit/delete actions)
   - Optional detail view modal/dialog
